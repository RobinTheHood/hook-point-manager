## How to use

### Default Hook Points (recommended)
This example shows you how to add all default hook points to modifieds core files. It's always better to look for a default hook point and use a default one or make a pull request to add a new default hook point:

### Register and add default Hook Points
```php
use RobinTheHood\HookPointManager\Classes\HookPointManager;

$hookPointManager = new HookPointManager();
$hookPointManager->registerDefault(); // adds default Hook Points to database
$hookPointManager->update(); // writes Hook Points to files
```

After that you can use all default hook points.


### Remove all Hook Points
```php
use RobinTheHood\HookPointManager\Classes\HookPointManager;

$hookPointManager = new HookPointManager();
$hookPointManager->remove(); // removes Hook Points from files
$hookPointManager->unregisterDefault(); // removes default Hook Points from database
```

After that all default hook points are removed.

#### Add a new default hook point
If you need a new default hook point, you can add one. First check whether there is already a default hook point that fits you needs. To add a new default hook point go to the directory */new_files/vendor-no-composer/robinthehood/HookPointManager/Classes/DefaultHookPoints/* and add your new hook point there. After that you have to make a pull request, so that every user and developer can use your new hook point. 

### Create your own very special Hook Point (not recommended)
If you need a very special hook point, you can create your own without a Pull Request. For example: because no one wants your new default pull request hook point and your pull request is refused ðŸ˜¢ðŸ¥º. This hook point is only usable for you, your projects and your module. This is **not recommended** if you can avoid it with a default hook point. You can find default hook points in */new_files/vendor-no-composer/robinthehood/HookPointManager/Classes/DefaultHookPoints/* or add a new default hook point with a pull request. If you still need your very super special hook point you can use the following code:

```php
$hookPointManager = new HookPointManager();

$hookPointManager->registerHookPoint([
    'name' => 'mc-my-hook-point-name',
    'module' => 'my-company/my-first-module',
    'file' => '/create_account.php',
    'hash' => '2b5ce65ba6177ed24c805609b28572a7',
    'line' => 30,
    'include' => '/includes/extra/my-company/my-first-module/create_account/'
], ['2.0.4.1', '2.0.4.2', '2.0.5.1']);
```
